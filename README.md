# Covalence

Covalence is an open-source framework based on Solidity that is designed to facilitate collaborative, private, and flexible valuation within communities. It leverages on-chain fully homomorphic encryption, allowing complex computations on encrypted data while maintaining total privacy. A web application accompanies the framework, providing an accessible interface and facilitating custom deployment.


## Potential use cases

The Covalence framework is versatile and can be applied in a multitude of contexts, including but not limited to:

- Collaborative Decision Making: Communities can engage in shared decision-making processes, fostering a culture of collaboration and equity.

- Performance Evaluation: The framework allows for a privacy-preserving assessment of individual performance based on various criteria, making it possible to automate the process of ranking and distributing rewards.

- Resource Allocation: In DAOs and other decentralized entities, the Covalence framework can facilitate a private and democratic resource distribution process based on collective decisions.

- Peer Reviews: Covalence can be used to establish a confidential and structured peer review system, where each member can evaluate others based on specified criteria, all while maintaining their privacy.

## Current Status

As of July & August 2023, the Covalence framework is in active development.
